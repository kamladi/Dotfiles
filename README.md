# Kedar Amladi's Dotfiles (Work in Progress)

## How to Install
Note: this installation will replace existing dotfiles in your `$HOME` and `.vim` directories, moving any existing dotfiles to a `dotfiles_old` folder.

* Download this repo
* edit/replace dotfiles with your own schtuff
* run `./setup.sh` from the command line

## TODO:
* Add proper Homebrew/NPM setup, installing required packages (node, mongodb, wget, tree, etc.)
* fill in vimrc, add vim plugins
* Add in my Sublime Text 2 packages and settings
